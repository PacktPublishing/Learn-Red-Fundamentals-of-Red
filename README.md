# Learn Red - Fundamentals of Red
This is the code repository for [Learn Red - Fundamentals of Red](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-red-fundamentals-red?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789130706), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
A key problem of software development today is software bloat, where huge toolchains and development environments are needed in software coding and deployment. Red significantly reduces this bloat by offering a minimalist but complete toolchain. This is the first introductory book about it, and it will get you up and running with Red as quickly as possible.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders. 

The code will look like the following:
```
Red [
    Name-Of-Info: "Value of Info"
    Name-Of-Info2: "Value of Info2"
    ...
]
```

Some knowledge of the basic concepts of programming and a bit of experience of any programming language, such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript, is assumed. To follow along with the examples and exercises, only a minimal install is required, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Setting Up for Development. Practice is the best way to learn a new language. That's why each chapter contains some questions and small exercises to try out your new skills. You'll find the solution in the code files and in the Assessments section
